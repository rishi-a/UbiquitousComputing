## ELL and EdgeML  

**ELL**: https://microsoft.github.io/ELL (Refer to this site for prepocessing data)  
**EdgeML**: https://github.com/microsoft/EdgeML (Refer to its readme to run the models) 
You can also clone EdgeML from the link above. But we suggest you to use our EdgeML folder as we fixed some _import_ issues in the python files. ELL works fine.   
For FastGRNN please go to EdgeML\examples\pytorch\FastCells\KWS-training\train_classifier.py
