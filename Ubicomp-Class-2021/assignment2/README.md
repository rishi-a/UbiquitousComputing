## Assignment 2. The aim of this assignment is to use camera/LED, photodiode transceiver to measure PPG.

This repository contains codes to reproduce the figures and results. The assignment details can be found [here](https://www.craft.do/s/MAdQrLOO9ErCvc/x/3EF62E9A-7E25-46FF-8C10-FFC4B6CFD4E9/b/EFDEA441-263D-4F05-B97F-A4156A8F54B2/Assignment_2). Link to the assignment report is [here](report.pdf).

**Reproducibility**
All the figures and the exeriments can be reproduced by running the single notebook titled [assignment-2.ipynb](assignment-2.ipynb).

**Dataset**
The ``video_data`` folder contains those PPG which were collected in synchronization with SCG. The folder ``IMU_data`` has the accelerometer recording. All other video recordings used to estimate pulse rate alone are in the root folder.
