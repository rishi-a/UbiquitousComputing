## Assignment 3 (Part 1). Evaluating Performance of Machine Learning Algorithms on Human Activity Recognition.

This repository contains codes to reproduce the results. The assignment details can be found [here](https://www.craft.do/s/MAdQrLOO9ErCvc/x/3EF62E9A-7E25-46FF-8C10-FFC4B6CFD4E9/b/E16C0165-FA68-4B31-A5E9-0ADD83C53DEB/Assignment_3). Link to the assignment report is [here](report.pdf).

**Reproducibility**

1. Run [baseline.ipynb](baseline.ipynb) to run the baseline algorithm.
2. Run [KNN+DTW.ipynb](KNN+DTW.ipynb) to run KNN with DTW on both raw acceleromter data and curated features.
3. Run [SVM.ipynb](SVM.ipynb) to run SVM algorithm on both raw acceleromter data and curated features.
4. Run [LSTM.ipynb](LSTM.ipynb) to run sequence model on both raw acceleromter data and raw gyroscope data.


**Dataset**
The ``data`` folder contains the Human Activity Recognition dataset. More information about the dataset can be found in the [report](report.pdf).
